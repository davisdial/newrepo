  <!-- <p>

    I’m 19 today,
    6939 days of life:
    Specifically, though, it feels like I’ve lived two lives.
    My life is characterized by the moment I discovered those 12 songs. 
    Before, life was fun. Life was running. Life was playing and laughing and adrenaline and lack of attention. 
    Life was simple.
    But the first time I sat down for 59 minutes and looked inward, I became me. Because every time On the Sea faded into my consciousness, the only apparent conclusion was that life is so beautiful. Life is meant to be lived. The very essence of happiness, sadness, and every conceivable emotion in between those lines are the result of our ongoing experience. I’m starting to think that this is the meaning of life: To truly feel. 
    Maybe that’s why we’re so ardently drawn toward people. It is the absence of them that creates unfeeling. 
    It’s moments like this that allow me to look back and evaluate the experiences I’ve had. I have had the privilege to meet people that have shaped my life. I was born into a family in a place under circumstances that led me to each of your lives, and I have nothing but gratitude for that. I think that’s also why I love music so much. It bridges the gap between both the people in and out of your life. Art is a bridge of the soul. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We imperfectly love. But there’s perfection in trying.
    We permanently feel. There’s death, otherwise.
    We selfishly grow. There’s nothing selfish about it. 
    We’re self absorbed. It’s a lesson-learned to be wise.
    We’re just humans. There’s nothing simple about it.
    We just really want life to be simple. But we’re just humans, after all.
    I’m only Nineteen, after all. 
  </p>
    
    <p>
    I feel strange tonight.
    After all the progress I’ve made, I feel strange tonight.
    Life is this and life is that–
    Are metaphors and parables even relevant anymore? Is that all we have to carve meaning into our indescribable lives? Are our lives even describable in the first place? 
    Art is the mere attempt at this—we utilize our failure to describe our perception of life to manifest it in a medium. We hide our lack of words in paintings and music and poems and sculptures and buildings and everything in between—all in that great pursuit of conveyance. What am I trying to convey in all of this?
